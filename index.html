        Hi I'm Yixin, and I'm a 3rd year computer engineering undergraduate at the University of Toronto. 
        I'm highly interested in 3D computer graphics, machine learning, and all intersections of the two fields - such as computer vision and AR/VR.

        This summer, I worked as a research intern at the D3M Lab, where we investigated using novel Neural Information Retrieval (Neural IR) techniques (specifically, TAS-B)
        to recommend recipes from natural text queries.

        In my free time, I like digital and traditional art, playing badminton, and exploring new cities. I'm also currently teaching myself raytracing and Vulkan.
